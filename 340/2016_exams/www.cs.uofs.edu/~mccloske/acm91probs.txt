Problem "A"
Firetruck

The Center City fire department collaborates with the transportation  
department to maintain maps of the city which reflects the current status of  
the city streets. On any given day, several streets are closed for repairs or  
construction.  Firefighters need to be able to select routes from the  
firestations to fires that do not use closed streets.   
Central City is divided into non-overlapping fire districts, each  
containing a single firestation. When a fire is reported, a central dispatcher  
alerts the firestation of the district where the fire is located and gives a  
list of possible routes from the firestation to the fire. You must write a  
program that the central dispatcher can use to generate routes from the  
district firestations to the fires.

Input and Output
The city has a separate map for each fire district. Streetcorners of each  
map are identified by positive integers less than 21, with the firestation  
always on corner #1. The input file contains several test cases representing  
different fires in different districts.  The first line of a test case  
consists of a single integer which is the number of the streetcorner closest  
to the fire. The next several lines consist of pairs of positive integers  
separated by blanks which are the adjacent streetcorners of open streets. (For  
example, if the pair 4 7 is on a line in the file, then the street between  
streetcorners 4 and 7 is open. There are no other streetcorners between 4 and  
7 on that section of the street.) The final line of each test case consists of  
a pair of 0’s.
For each test case, your output must identify the case by number (case #1,  
case #2, etc). It must list each route on a separate line, with the  
streetcorners written in the order in which they appear on the route. And it  
must give the total number routes from firestation to the fire.  Include only  
routes which do not pass through any streetcorner more than once.  (For  
obvious reasons, the fire department doesn’t want its trucks driving around in  
circles.) Output from separate cases must appear on separate lines. The  
following sample input and corresponding correct output represents two test  
cases.

Problem "B"
Triangular Vertices

Consider the points on an infinite grid of equilateral triangles as shown  
below:
               x
              x x
             x x x
            x x x x
           x x x x x
               .
               .


Note that if we number the points from left to right and top to bottom,  
then groups of these points form the vertices of certain geometric shapes. For  
example, the sets of points {1,2,3} and {7,9,18} are the vertices of  
triangles, the sets {11,13,26,24} and {2,7,9,18} are the vertices of  
parallelograms, and the sets {4,5,9,13,12,7} and {8,10,17,21,32,34} are the  
vertices of hexagons.

Write a program which will repeatedly accept a set of points on this  
triangular grid, analyze it, and determine whether the points are the vertices  
of one of the following “acceptable” figures: triangle, parallelogram, or  
hexagon. In order for a figure to be acceptable, it must meet the following  
two conditions:
      1) Each side of the figure must coincide with an edge in the grid.
and   2) All sides of the figure must be of the same length.


Input and Output

The input will consist of an unknown number of point sets. Each point set  
will appear on a separate line in the file. There are at most six points in a  
set and the points are limited to the range 1..32767.

For each point set in the input file, your program should deduce from the  
number of points in the set which geometric figure the set potentially  
represents; e.g., six points can only represent a hexagon, etc. The output  
must be a series of lines listing each point set followed by the results of  
your analysis.  

Sample Input      Sample Output

1 2 3             1 2 3 are the vertices of a triangle
11 13 29 31       11 13 29 31 are not the vertices of an acceptable figure
26 11 13 24       26 11 13 24 are the vertices of a parallelogram
4 5 9 13 12 7     4 5 9 13 12 7 are the vertices of a hexagon
1 2 3 4 5         1 2 3 4 5 are not the vertices of an acceptable figure
47                47 are not the vertices of an acceptable figure
11 13 23 25       11 13 23 25 are not the vertices of an acceptable figure
==============================================================================
Problem "C"
Concurrency Simulator

Programs executed concurrently on a uniprocessor system appear to be  
executed at the same time, but in reality the single CPU alternates between  
the programs, executing some number of instructions from each program before  
switching to the next. You are to simulate the concurrent execution of up to  
ten programs on such a system and determine the output that they will produce.  

The program that is currently being executed is said to be running, while  
all programs awaiting execution are said to be ready.  A program consists of a  
sequence of no more than 25 statements, one per line, followed by an end  
statement. The statements available are listed below.

Statement Type               Syntax
Assignment                   variable = constant
Output                       print variable
Begin Mutual Exclusion       lock
End Mutual Exclusion         unlock
Stop Execution               end

A variable is any single lowercase alphabetic character and a constant is an  
unsigned decimal number less than 100. There are only 26 variables in the  
computer system, and they are shared among the programs. Thus assignments to a  
variable in one program affect the value that might be printed by a different  
program. All variables are initially set to zero.


Each statement requires an integral number of time units to execute. The  
running program is permitted to continue executing instructions for a period  
of time called its quantum. When a program’s time quantum expires, another  
ready program will be selected to run. Any instruction currently being  
executed when the time quantum expires will be allowed to complete.  

Programs are queued first-in-first-out for execution in a ready queue. The  
initial order of the ready queue corresponds to the original order of the  
programs in the input file. This order can change, however, as a result of the  
execution of lock and unlock statements.  

The lock and unlock statements are used whenever a program wishes to  
claim mutually exclusive access to the variables it is manipulating. These  
statements always occur in pairs, bracketing  one or more other statements. A  
lock will always precede an unlock, and these statements will never be  
nested. Once a program successfully executes a lock statement, no other  
program may successfully execute a lock statement until the locking program  
runs and executes the corresponding unlock statement. Should a running  
program attempt to execute a lock while one is already in effect, this  
program will be placed at the end of the blocked queue. Programs blocked in  
this fashion lose any of their current time quantum remaining. When an unlock  
is executed, any program at the head of the blocked queue is moved to the head  
of the ready queue. The first statement this program will execute when it runs  
will be the lock statement that previously failed. Note that it is up to the  
programs involved to enforce the mutual exclusion protocol through correct  
usage of lock and unlock statements. (A renegade program with no  
lock/unlock pair could alter any variables it wished, despite the proper use  
of lock/unlock by the other programs.)


Input and Output

The first line of the input file consists of seven integers separated by  
spaces.  These integers specify (in order): the number of programs which  
follow, the unit execution times for each of the five statements (in the order  
given above), and the number of time units comprising the time quantum. The  
remainder of the input consists of the programs, which are correctly formed  
from statements according to the rules described above.

All program statements begin in the first column of a line. Blanks  
appearing in a statement should be ignored.  Associated with each program is  
an identification number based upon its location in the input data (the first  
program has ID = 1, the second has ID = 2, etc.).

Your output will contain of the output generated by the print statements as  
they occur during the simulation. When a print statement is executed, your  
program should display the program ID, a colon, a space, and the value of the  
selected variable. Output from separate print statements should appear on  
separate lines. A sample input and correct output are shown below.

Sample Input         Sample Output

3 1 1 1 1 1 1        1: 3  
a = 4                2: 3
print a              3: 17
lock                 3: 9
b = 9                1: 9
print b              1: 9
unlock               2: 8
print b              2: 8
end                  3: 21

Problem "D"
The Domino Effect

A standard set of Double Six dominoes contains 28 pieces (called bones)  
each displaying two numbers from 0 (blank) to 6 using dice-like pips. The 28  
bones, which are unique, consist of the following combinations of pips:

Bone #     Pips    Bone #     Pips    Bone #     Pips    Bone #     Pips

1        0 | 0      8       1 | 1    15        2         22       3 | 6
2        0 | 1      9       1 | 2    16        2 | 4     23       4 | 4
3        0 | 2      10      1 | 3    17        2 | 5     24       4 | 5
4        0 | 3      11      1 | 4    18        2 | 6     25       4 | 6
5        0 | 4      12      1 | 5    19        3 | 3     26       5 | 5
6        0 | 5      13      1 | 6    20        3 | 4     27       5 | 6

All the Double Six dominoes in a set can he laid out to display a 7 x 8  
grid of pips.  Each layout corresponds at least one “map” of the dominoes. A  
map consists of an identical 7 x 8 grid with the appropriate bone numbers  
substituted for the pip numbers appearing on that bone. An example of a 7 x 8  
grid display of pips and a corresponding map of bone numbers is shown below.

Write a program that will analyze the pattern of pips in any 7 x 8 layout  
of a standard set of dominoes and produce a map showing the position of all  
dominoes in the set. If more than one arrangement of dominoes yield the same  
pattern, your program should generate a map of each possible layout.  


Input and Output

The input file will contain several of problem sets.  Each set consists of  
seven lines of eight integers from 0 through 6, representing an observed  
pattern of pips. Each set is corresponds to a legitimate configuration of  
bones (there will be at least one map possible for each problem set). There is  
no intervening data separating the problem sets.

Correct output consists of a problem set label (beginning with Set #1)  
followed by an echo printing of the problem set itself. This is followed by a  
map label for the set and the map(s) which correspond to the problem set.  
(Multiple maps can be output in any order.) After all maps for a problem set  
have been printed, a summary line stating the number of possible maps appears.  
At least three lines are skipped between the output from different problem  
sets while at least one line separates the labels, echo printing, and maps  
within the same problem set. A sample input file of two problem sets along  
with the correct output are shown on the reverse of this page.

Problem "E"
Use of Hospital Facilities

County General Hospital is trying to chart its course through the troubled
waters of the economy and shifting population demographics.  To support the
planning requirements of the hospital, you have been asked to develop a
simulation program that will allow the hospital to evaluate alternative
configurations of operating rooms, recovery rooms and operations guidelines.
Your program will monitor the usage of operating rooms and recovery room beds
during the course of one day.

County General Hospital has several operating rooms and recovery room beds.
Each surgery patient is assigned to an available operating room and following
surgery the patient is assigned to one of the recovery room beds.  The amount
of time necessary to transport a patient from an operating room to a recovery
room is fixed and independent of the patient. Similarly, both the amount of
time to prepare an operating room for the next patient and the amount of time
to prepare a recovery room bed for a new patient are fixed.

All patients are officially scheduled for surgery at the same time, but the
order in which they actually go into the operating rooms depends on the order
of the patient roster. A patient entering surgery goes into the lowest
numbered operating room available. For example, if rooms 2 and 4 become
available simultaneously, the next patient on the roster not yet in surgery
goes into room 2 and the next after that goes into room 4 at the same time.
After surgery, a patient is taken to the available recovery room bed with the
lowest number.  If two patients emerge from surgery at the same time, the
patient with the lower number will be the first assigned to a recovery room
bed.  (If in addition the two patients entered surgery at the same time, the
one first on the roster is first assigned a bed.)


Input and Output

The input file contains data for a single simulation run.  All numeric data
in the input file are integers, and successive integers on the same line are
separated by blanks.  The first line of the file is the set of hospital
configuration parameters to be used for this run.  The parameters are, in
order:

   Number of operating rooms  (maximum of 10)
   Number of recovery room beds  (maximum of 30)
   Starting hour for 1st surgery of day (based on a 24-hour clock)
   Minutes to transport patient from operating room to recovery room
   Minutes to prepare operating room for next patient
   Minutes to prepare recovery room bed for next patient
   Number of surgery patients for the day   (maximum of 100)

This initial configuration data will be followed by pairs of lines of
patient data as follows:

Line 1: Last name of patient (maximum of 8 characters)
Line 2: Minutes required for surgery   Minutes required in the recovery room

Patient records in the input file are ordered according to the patient roster,
which determines the order in which patients are scheduled for surgery.  The
number of recovery room beds specified in any configuration will be sufficient
to handle patients arriving from surgery (No queuing of patients for recovery
room beds will be required). Computed times will not extend past 24:00.

Correct output shows which operating room and which recovery room bed is
used by each patient, and the time period that the patient uses the room and
bed along with a summary of the utilization of hospital facilities for that
day.  The output file consists of a set of two tables describing the results
of the simulation run.  The first table is in columnar form with appropriate
column labels to show the number of each patient (in the order the patient
roster), the patient’s last name, the operating room number, the time surgery
beings and ends, the recovery bed number and the time the patient enters and
leaves the recovery room bed.



The second table will also be in columnar form with appropriate column
labels summarizing the utilization of operating rooms and recovery room beds.
This summary indicates the facility type (room or bed), the facility number,
the number of minutes used and percentage of available time utilized.
Available time is defined as the time in minutes from the starting time for
1st surgery of day to the ending time of the last patient in a recovery room

Problem "F"
Message Decoding

Some message encoding schemes require that an encoded message be sent in  
two parts.  The first part, called the header, contains the characters of the  
message.  The second part contains a pattern that represents the message.  You  
must write a program that can decode messages under such a scheme.

The heart of the encoding scheme for your program is a sequence of “key”  
strings of 0’s and 1’s as follows:

   0,00,01,10,000,001,010,011,100,101,110,0000,0001,. . .,1011,1110,00000,  
. . .

The first key in the sequence is of length 1, the next 3 are of length 2, the  
next 7 of length 3, the next 15 of length 4, etc.  If two adjacent keys have  
the same length, the second can be obtained from the first by adding 1 (base  
2).  Notice that there are no keys in the sequence that consist only of 1’s.

The keys are mapped to the characters in the header in order.  That is, the  
first key (0) is mapped to the first character in the header, the second key  
(00) to the second character in the header, the kth key is mapped to the kth  
character in the header.  For example, suppose the header is:

   AB#TANCnrtXc

Then 0 is mapped to A, 00 to B, 01 to #, 10 to T, 000 to A, ..., 110 to X, and  
0000 to c.

The encoded message contains only 0’s and 1’s and possibly carriage  
returns, which are to be ignored.  The message is divided into segments.  The  
first 3 digits of a segment give the binary representation of the length of  
the keys in the segment.  For example, if the first 3 digits are 010, then the  
remainder of the segment consists of keys of length 2 (00, 01, or 10).  The  
end of the segment is a string of 1’s which is the same length as the length  
of the keys in the segment.  So a segment of keys of length 2 is terminated by  
11.  The entire encoded message is terminated by 000 (which would signify a  
segment in which the keys have length 0).  The message is decoded by  
translating the keys in the segments one-at-a-time into the header characters  
to which they have been mapped.  


Input and Output

The input file contains several data sets.  Each data set consists of a  
header, which is on a single line by itself, and a message, which may extend  
over several lines.  The length of the header is limited only by the fact that  
key strings have a maximum length of 7 (111 in binary).   If there are  
multiple copies of a character in a header, then several keys will map to that  
character.  The encoded message contains only 0’s and 1’s, and it is a  
legitimate encoding according to the described scheme.  That is, the message  
segments begin with the 3-digit length sequence and end with the appropriate  
sequence of 1’s.  The keys in any given segment are all of the same length,  
and they all correspond to characters in the header.  The message is  
terminated by 000.  Carriage returns may appear anywhere within the message  
part. They are not to be considered as part of the message.  

For each data set, your program must write its decoded message on a  
separate line.  There should not be blank lines between messages.  Sample  
input and corrresponding correct output are shown below.

Problem "G"
Code Generation

Your employer needs a backend for a translator for a very SIC machine  
(Simplified Instructional Computer, apologies to Leland Beck). Input to the  
translator will be arithmetic expressions in postfix form and the output will  
be assembly language code.  

The target machine has a single register and the following instructions,  
where the operand is either an identifier or a storage location.    

L    load the operand into the register
A    add the operand to the contents of the register
S    subtract the operand from the contents of the register
M    multiply the contents of the register by the operand
D    divide the contents of the register by the operand
N    negate the contents of the register
ST   store the contents of the register in the operand location
  
An arithmetic operation replaces the contents of the register with the  
expression result.  Temporary storage locations are allocated by the assembler  
for an operand  of the form “$n” where n is a single digit.    


Input and Output

The input file consists of several legitimate postfix expressions, each on  
a separate line.  Expression operands are single letters and operators are the  
normal arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) and unary negation (@).  Output must  
be assembly language code that meets the following requirements:    

1.  One instruction per line with the instruction mnemonic separated from  
the operand (if any) by one blank.
2.  One blank line must separate the assembly code for successive  
expressions.   
3.  The original order of the operands must be preserved in the assembly  
code.  
4.  Assembly code must be generated for each operator as soon as it is  
encountered.  
5.  As few temporaries as possible should be used (given the above  
restrictions).
6.  For each operator in the expression, the minimum number of instructions  
must be generated (given the above restrictions).      

A sample input file and corrresponding correct output are on the reverse of  
this paper.
