Problem A
Borrowers

I mean your borrowers of booksÑthose mutilators of collections, spoilers of  
the symmetry of shelves, and creators of odd volumes.
ÑCharles Lamb, Essays of Elia (1823) ÔThe Two Races of MenÕ

Like Mr. Lamb, librarians have their problems with borrowers too. People donÕt  
put books back where they should. Instead, returned books are kept at the main  
desk until a librarian is free to replace them in the right places on the  
shelves. Even for librarians, putting the right book in the right place can be  
very time-consuming. But since many libraries are now computerized, you can  
write a program to help.

When a borrower takes out or returns a book, the computer keeps a record of  
the title. Periodically, the librarians will ask your program for a list of  
books that have been returned so the books can be returned to their correct  
places on the shelves. Before they are returned to the shelves, the returned  
books are sorted by author and then title using the ASCII collating sequence.  
Your program should output the list of returned books in the same order as  
they should appear on the shelves. For each book, your program should tell the  
librarian which book (including those previously shelved) is already on the  
shelf before which the returned book should go.

Input
First, the stock of the library will be listed, one book per line, in no  
particular order. Initially, they are all on the shelves. No two books have  
the same title. The format of each line will be:
        "title" by author
The end of the stock listing will be marked by a line containing only the  
word:
        END
Following the stock list will be a series of records of books borrowed and  
returned, and requests from librarians for assistance in restocking the  
shelves. Each record will appear on a single line, in one of the following  
formats:
        BORROW "title"
        RETURN "title"
        SHELVE
The list will be terminated by a line containing only the word:
        END

Output
Each time the SHELVE command appears, your program should output a series of  
instructions for the librarian, one per line, in the format:
        Put "title1" after "title2"
or, for the special case of the book being the first in the collection:
        Put "title" first
After the set of instructions for each SHELVE, output a line containing only  
the word:
        END

Assumptions & Limitations
1.      A title is at most 80 characters long.
2.      An author is at most 80 characters long.
3.      A title will not contain the double quote (") character.

Sample Input
"The Canterbury Tales" by Chaucer, G.
"Algorithms" by Sedgewick, R.
"The C Programming Language" by Kernighan, B. and Ritchie, D.
END
BORROW "Algorithms"
BORROW "The C Programming Language"
RETURN "Algorithms"
RETURN "The C Programming Language"
SHELVE
END

Output for the Sample Input
Put "The C Programming Language" after "The Canterbury Tales"
Put "Algorithms" after "The C Programming Language"
END



Problem B
Testing the CATCHER

A military contractor for the Department of Defense has just completed a  
series of preliminary tests for a new defensive missile called the CATCHER  
which is capable of intercepting multiple incoming offensive missiles. The  
CATCHER is supposed to be a remarkable defensive missile. It can move forward,  
laterally, and downward at very fast speeds, and it can intercept an offensive  
missile without being damaged. But it does have one major flaw. Although it  
can be fired to reach any initial elevation, it has no power to move higher  
than the last missile that it has intercepted.

The tests which the contractor completed were computer simulations of  
battlefield and hostile attack conditions. Since they were only preliminary,  
the simulations tested only the CATCHERÕs vertical movement capability. In  
each simulation, the CATCHER was fired at a sequence of offensive missiles  
which were incoming at fixed time intervals. The only information available to  
the CATCHER for each incoming missile was its height at the point it could be  
intercepted and where it appeared in the sequence of missiles. Each incoming  
missile for a test run is represented in the sequence only once.

The result of each test is reported as the sequence of incoming missiles and  
the total number of those missiles that are intercepted by the CATCHER in that  
test.

The General Accounting Office wants to be sure that the simulation test  
results submitted by the military contractor are attainable, given the  
constraints of the CATCHER. You must write a program that takes input data  
representing the pattern of incoming missiles for several different tests and  
outputs the maximum numbers of missiles that the CATCHER can intercept for  
those tests. For any incoming missile in a test, the CATCHER is able to  
intercept it if and only if it satisfies one of these two conditions:

1.      The incoming missile is the first missile to be intercepted in this  
test.
-or-
2.      The missile was fired after the last missile that was intercepted and it  
is not higher than the last missile which was intercepted.

Input and Output
The input data for any test consists of a sequence of one or more non-negative  
integers, all of which are less than or equal to 32,767, representing the  
heights of the incoming missiles (the test pattern). The last number in each  
sequence is -1, which signifies the end of data for that particular test and  
is not considered to represent a missile height. The end of data for the  
entire input is the number -1 as the first value in a test; it is not  
considered to be a separate test.

Output for each test consists of a test number (Test #1, Test #2, etc.) and  
the maximum number of incoming missiles that the CATCHER could possibly  
intercept for the test. That maximum number appears after an identifying  
message. There must be at least one blank line between output for successive  
data sets. On the back of this page is a sample input file which consists of  
two different scenarios and the corresponding output.


NOTE:   The number of missiles for any given test is not limited. If your  
solution is based on an inefficient algorithm, it may not execute in the  
allotted time.

Problem C
Crossword Answers

A crossword puzzle consists of a rectangular grid of black and white squares  
and two lists of definitions (or descriptions). One list of definitions is for  
ÒwordsÓ to be written left to right across white squares in the rows and the  
other list is for words to be written down white squares in the columns. (A  
word is a sequence of alphabetic characters.) To solve a crossword puzzle, one  
writes the words corresponding to the definitions on the white squares of the  
grid.

The definitions correspond to the rectangular grid by means of sequential  
integers on ÒeligibleÓ white squares. White squares with black squares  
immediately to the left or above them are "eligible." White squares with no  
squares either immediately to the left or above are also Òeligible.Ó No other  
squares are numbered. All of the squares on the first row are numbered. The  
numbering starts with 1 and continues consecutively across white squares of  
the first row, then across the eligible white squares of the second row, then  
across the eligible white squares of the third row and so on across all of the  
rest of the rows of the puzzle. The picture below illustrates a rectangular  
crossword puzzle grid with appropriate numbering.



An ÒacrossÓ word for a definition is written on a sequence of white squares in  
a row starting on a numbered square that does not follow another white square  
in the same row. The sequence of white squares for that word goes across the  
row of the numbered square, ending immediately before the next black square in  
the row or in the rightmost square of the row.

A ÒdownÓ word for a definition is written on a sequence of white squares in a  
column starting on a numbered square that does not follow another white square  
in the same column. The sequence of white squares for that word goes down the  
column of the numbered square, ending immediately before the next black square  
in the column or in the bottom square of the column. Every white square in a  
correctly solved puzzle contains a letter.

You must write a program that takes several solved crossword puzzles as input  
and outputs the lists of across and down words which constitute the solutions.

Input
Each puzzle solution in the input starts with a line containing two integers r  
and c (1² r ²10 and 1² c ²10), where r (the first number) is the number of  
rows in the puzzle and c (the second number) is the number of columns. The r  
rows of input which follow each contain c characters (excluding the end-of-
line) which describe the solution. Each of those c characters is an alphabetic  
character which is part of a word or the character "*", which indicates a  
black square. The end of input is indicated by a line consisting of the single  
number 0.

Output
Output for each puzzle consists of an identifier for the puzzle (puzzle #1,  
puzzle #2, etc.) and the list of across words followed by the list of down  
words. Words in each list must be output one-per-line in increasing order of  
the number of their corresponding definitions. The heading for the list of  
across words is ÒAcrossÓ. The heading for the list of down words is ÒDownÓ. In  
the case where the lists are empty (all squares in the grid are black), the  
Across and Down headings should still appear.

Problem D
Package Pricing

The Green Earth Trading Company sells 4 different sizes of energy-efficient  
fluorescent light bulbs for use in home lighting fixtures. The light bulbs are  
expensive, but last much longer than ordinary incandescent light bulbs and  
require much less energy. To encourage customers to buy and use the energy-
efficient light bulbs, the company catalogue lists special packages which  
contain a variety of sizes and numbers of the light bulbs. The price of a  
package is always substantially less than the total price of the individual  
bulbs in the package. Customers typically want to buy several different sizes  
and numbers of bulbs. You are to write a program to determine the least  
expensive collection of packages that satisfy any customerÕs request.

Input
The input file is divided into two parts. The first one describes the packages  
which are listed in the catalogue. The second part describes individual  
customer requests. The 4 sizes of light bulbs are identified in the input file  
by the characters "a", "b", "c", and "d".

The first part of the input file begins with an integer n (1² n ²50)  
indicating the number of packages described in the catalogue. Each of the n  
lines that follows is a single package description. A package description  
begins with a catalogue number (a positive integer) followed by a price (a  
real number), and then the sizes and corresponding numbers of the light bulbs  
in the package. Between 1 and 4 different sizes of light bulbs will be listed  
in each description. The listing format for these size-number pairs is a  
blank, a character ("a", "b", "c", or "d") representing a size, another blank,  
and then an integer representing the number of light bulbs of that size in the  
package. These size-number pairs will not appear in any particular order, and  
there will be no duplicate sizes listed in any package. The following line  
describes a package with catalogue number 210 and price $76.95 which contains  
3 size "a" bulbs, 1 size "c" bulb, and 4 size "d" bulbs.

        210 76.95 a 3 c 1 d 4

The second part of the input file begins with a line containing a single  
positive integer m representing the number of customer requests. Each of the  
remaining m lines is a customer request. A listing of sizes and corresponding  
numbers of light bulbs constitutes a request. Each list contains only the  
size-number pairs, formatted the same way that the size-number pairs are  
formatted in the catalogue descriptions. Unlike the catalogue descriptions,  
however, a customer request may contain duplicate sizes. The following line  
represents a customer request for 1 size "a" bulb, 2 size "b" bulbs, 2 size  
"c" bulbs, and 5 size "d" bulbs.

        a 1 d 5 b 1 c 2 b 1

Output
For each request, print the customer number (1 through m, 1 for the first  
customer request, 2 for the second, É, m for the mth customer), a colon, the  
total price of the packages which constitute the least expensive way to fill  
the request, and then the combination of packages that the customer should  
order to fill that request.  

Prices should be shown with exactly two significant digits to the right of the  
decimal. The combination of packages must be written in ascending order of  
catalogue numbers. If more than one of the same type package is to be ordered,  
then the number ordered should follow the catalogue number in parentheses. You  
may assume that each customer request can be filled. In some cases, the least  
expensive way to fill a customer request may contain more light bulbs of some  
sizes than necessary to fill the actual request. This is acceptable. What  
matters is that the customers receive at least what they request.

Problem E
Switching Channels

CPN (The Couch Potato Network) owns several cable channels. They would like to  
arrange the timing of programmes so viewers can switch channels without  
missing the end of one programme or the beginning of another. To do this they  
have identified certain times, called Òalignment points,Ó where ideally one  
programme should end and another should begin. Some of these alignment points  
are more important than others. For example, the time when the nightly news  
begins is an important alignment point. Since many viewers watch the news,  
they would be less likely to watch a CPN programme whose ending time causes  
them to miss the beginning of the news, or which starts before the news  
finishes. Your task is to write a solution which determines the best order in  
which programmes can be shown on one channel.

A ÒmissÓ time is the absolute value of the difference between the time of an  
alignment point and the nearest time of the beginning or end of a programme.  
The Òtotal miss timeÓ at a particular level of importance is the sum of all  
the miss times for alignment points at that level of importance. One programme  
order is better than another if it has a lower total miss time at some level  
of importance and the same total miss time at all higher levels of importance  
(if any).

Input
Your solution must accept multiple input data sets. Each set will begin with  
an integer, p (0² p ²8), specifying the number of programmes to be ordered.  
When a data set beginning with 0 is encountered, your solution should  
terminate. Following p on the same line will be p integers specifying the  
lengths of the programmes in minutes. There is no significance to the order in  
which these are given.

The next line of input specifies the alignment points. The total number of  
such points, a (0² a ²8), appears first followed by a pairs of integers. The  
first integer in each pair, i (1² i ²5), gives the importance of the alignment  
point. Alignment points marked 1 are most important; those marked 2 are of  
secondary importance, etc. The second integer in each pair, t, specifies the  
time when the alignment point occurs. No two alignment points in the same data  
set will have the same value of t.

Output
Your solution must output three lines for each data set. The first line  
identifies the data set being processed and should be in the form:
        Data set n
where n is the number of the data set (1 for the first data set, 2 for the  
second, etc.). On the following line, your solution should output the lengths  
of the programmes in the order in which they should be shown to achieve the  
best synchronization with the alignment points. On the third line, output the  
total number of minutes by which the alignment points were missed (the sum of  
all total miss times).

There may be more than one best programme order for an input data set. Any one  
of these best orders is acceptable.

Problem F
Typesetting

Proportional fonts are so called because characters require varying amounts of  
space on the printed line. The size in which text is Òset,Ó usually measured  
in points, also affects the space required for each character. In this problem  
you are given a number of paragraphs of text to set. Each paragraph may  
include special ÒwordsÓ to select the font and point size.

The input starts with the font width table. These data give the widths of 10-
point characters in six different fonts. The first line contains the number of  
characters in the table, N (0² N ²100). Each of the next N lines contain a  
character in column 1 and then 6 integers representing the width of that  
character in each of the 6 different fonts. Widths are given in an arbitrary  
measurement called Òunits.Ó The width of each 10-point character will be  
greater than zero units, and less than 256 units. Character widths scale  
linearly with point size. Thus if a 10-point ÒAÓ is 12 units wide, a 20-point  
ÒAÓ is 24 units wide.

The remainder of the input consists of paragraphs to be typeset. Each  
paragraph begins with a line containing two integers, L and W. L is the number  
of input lines of text for the paragraph (these immediately follow the first  
line), and W is the width allowed for each typeset line, in units. The initial  
font at the beginning of each paragraph is always font 1, and the initial  
point size in which characters are to be set is 10. Fonts are numbered 1  
through 6, corresponding to columns 1 through 6 in the font width table. An  
empty paragraph (one for which L is 0) will mark the end of the input data. No  
output is to be produced for this empty paragraph.

The words in each paragraph are sequences of no more than 8 non-blank  
characters separated by spaces (that is, blanksÑno tab characters will appear  
in the input). Spaces at the ends of input lines are irrelevant, and spaces  
between words are significant only to the extent that they separate words.  
Each character in each word will appear in the width table. Case is  
significant for all characters in the input data.

The special tokens "*f1", "*f2", "*f3", "*f4", "*f5", and "*f6" are used to  
select a particular font to be used in setting the text that follows it. The  
token "*sN", where N is an integer in the range 1 to 99 indicates that N point  
characters are to be used in setting the following text. These tokens will  
always be separated from words and other tokens by at least one blank. Note  
that style and size changes made in one paragraph do not carry over to the  
next paragraph, and that many such changes may appear in a single paragraph.

For each paragraph, try to set as many words per line as possible, ensuring  
that each word is followed by at least the width of a blank (which will always  
appear in the font width table) with the same point size and style as the  
characters in the preceding word, except for the last word on the line. The  
last word in a typeset line must not have any following space.

When scaling fonts, round the scaled character widths to the nearest integer,  
rounding upward in cases where the rounded value is half way between two  
consecutive integers. Thus, if a particular 10 point character occupies 9  
units of space, a 15 point character would occupy 14 units of space, as would  
a 16 point character. A 14 point character, however, would occupy only 13  
units of space.

For each paragraph, first display the paragraph number (1, 2, ...). Then, for  
each typeset line in the paragraph, display the line number, the first and  
last words on that line, and the total number of units of white space that  
follow the last character printed on the line. (This is just the number of  
units of space available on the line not occupied by characters or spaces  
between characters.)

If a single word exceeds the width of a line, set it on a line by itself. In  
the output for that line, show only that single word, and a negative amount of  
white space equal to the excess width of the word.

Problem G
VTAS - Vessel Traffic Advisory Service

In order to promote safety and efficient use of port facilities, the  
Association of Coastal Merchants (ACM) has developed a concept for a Vessel  
Traffic Advisory Service (VTAS) that will provide traffic advisories for  
vessels transiting participating ports.

The concept is built on a computer program that maintains information about  
the traffic patterns and reported movements of vessels within the port over  
multiple days. For each port, the traffic lanes are defined between waypoints.  
The traffic lanes have been designated as directional to provide traffic  
separation and flow controls. Each port is represented by a square matrix  
containing the distances (in nautical miles) along each valid traffic lane.  
The distances are defined from each row waypoint to each column waypoint. A  
distance of 0 indicates that no valid traffic lane exists between the two  
waypoints.

Vessel traffic enters the port at a waypoint and transits the traffic lanes. A  
vessel may begin its transit at any of the waypoints and must follow a valid  
connected route via the valid traffic lanes. A vessel may end its transit at  
any valid waypoint.

The service provided by the VTAS to transiting vessels includes:
        ¥       Projection of arrival times at waypoints
        ¥       Notification of invalid routes
        ¥       Projected encounters with other vessels on each leg of the  
transit. An ÒencounterÓ occurs when two vessels are between common waypoints  
(either traffic lane) at a common time
        ¥       Warning of close passing with another vessel in the vicinity of a  
waypoint (within 3 minutes of projected waypoint arrival)  

Reported times will be rounded to the nearest whole minute. Time is maintained  
based on a 24 hour clock (i.e. 9 am is 0900, 9 PM is 2100, midnight is 0000).  
Speed is measured in knots which is equal to 1 nautical mile per hour.

Input
The input file for the computer program include a Port Specification to  
provide the description of the traffic patterns within the port and a Traffic  
List which contains the sequence of vessels entering the port and their  
intended tracks. The end of the input is indicated by a Vessel Name beginning  
with an "*"
Port Specification :    Number of Waypoints in Port (an integer N)
        Waypoint ID List (N single-character designators)
        Waypoint Connection Matrix (N rows of N real values specifying the  
distances between waypoints in nautical miles)
Traffic List:   Vessel Name (alphabetic characters)
        Time at first waypoint (on 24-hour clock) & Planned Transit Speed (in  
knots)
        Planned Route (ordered list of waypoints)  

Output
The output shall provide for each vessel as it enters the port a listing  
indicating the arrival of the vessel and its planned speed followed by a table  
containing the waypoints in its route and projected arrival at each waypoint.  
Following this table will be appropriate messages indicating:
        ¥       Notification of Invalid Routes
        ¥       Projected Encounters on each leg
        ¥       Warning of close passing at waypoints
All times are to be printed as four-digit integers with leading zeros when  
necessary.

Assumptions & Limitations
1.      Vessel names are at most 20 characters long.
2.      There are at most 20 waypoints in a port and at most 20 waypoints in any  
route.
3.      There will be at most 20 vessels in port at any time.
4.      A vessel will complete its transit in at most 12 hours.
5.      No more than 24 hours will elapse between vessel entries.

Problem H
Monitoring Wheelchair Patients

A researcher at a rehabilitation facility is studying the use that a patient  
makes of a motorized wheelchair in a restricted area at the facility. The  
chairÕs motor is connected to the axle by a chain drive. Therefore both wheels  
turn at the same speed and the chair can travel only in a straight line. The  
patient can stop the chair, rotate the wheels, and thereby change the  
direction only while the wheelchair is stopped. To help monitor its usage, the  
chair is equipped with a compass, a clock, and a speedometer. A recording  
device records each time interval that the chair is in motion, the average  
speed during the time interval, and the compass bearing during the time  
interval. The compass is a standard compass in which 0û is north, 90û is east,  
and so forth.
        
A map of the restricted area is shown. The restricted area is a 200 ft by 400  
ft rectangular area of the lawn. Patients enter the restricted area from the  
door of a building located on the southern edge of the restricted area. The  
door is at the center of the 400 ft southern boundary, as shown in the figure.

The recording device turns itself on when the patient enters the restricted  
area through the door and monitors the patientÕs movements for up to 1 hour.  
Time is measured in seconds from 0 to 3600, with time 0 being the time the  
patient initially enters the restricted area through the door. The device  
records 4 numbers to describe the motion of the wheelchair during any interval  
when the motor is in operation. The first two numbers give the time the motion  
begins and ends; the third number gives the speed during the time interval;  
and the fourth number gives the compass bearing during the time interval.  
(During each time interval the wheelchair maintains constant speed and  
bearing.) For example, the recorded line
10.6    15.9    2.8     274
would indicate that between times t1 = 10.6 and t2 = 15.9 seconds the  
wheelchair was traveling at speed of 2.8 ft/sec with compass bearing  
(direction) 274û. Times are recorded to 0.1 sec, speeds are recorded to 0.1  
ft/sec, and bearings are recorded to a whole number of degrees.

Your job is to analyze the data from the wheelchairÕs recording device.  
Specifically, you must determine the following:
        1)      Did the patient ever leave the restricted area? If so, determine  
the first time that the patient left the restricted area and determine at what  
point on the perimeter of the restricted area the wheelchair crossed out of  
the restricted area. If the patient did not leave the restricted area, what  
was the distance from the door to the farthest point the patient reached  
within the area?
        2)      What was the total distance that the patient traveled?

For the purpose of answering these questions, use coordinates with the  
location (0,0) corresponding to the southwest corner of the restricted area  
and the location (400,200) corresponding to the northeast corner. Since the  
recorder switches on when the patient passes through the door, the position of  
the patient at time t = 0.0 is always (200,0). Patients will be traveling  
north when they enter the restricted area.  

Input
The input data consists of several data sets. The first line of each data set  
has an integer which is the number of lines recorded by the device. Each  
subsequent line in the data set consists of the four numbers recorded by the  
device during a particular time interval. The end of data is indicated by a  
data set whose first line consists of the number 0.

In the first data set of the sample input, the patient entered through the  
door (at time 0.0) and for the first 5 seconds was traveling due north at 3  
ft/sec. From time t = 7 to t = 9 he traveled at a speed of 2 ft/sec with a  
compass bearing of 30û. He then stopped, changed his bearing to 60û, and then  
traveled at 4 ft/sec from time t = 10 to time t = 100. Ten seconds later (at  
time t = 110) he headed due north at 2 ft/sec until t = 200.

Output
The output for each data set begins with an identification of that case. The  
output indicates whether the patient departed from the restricted area and if  
so the time and point of departure on the perimeter . If not, the maximum  
distance the patient reached from the door is provided. For each case, the  
total distance that the patient traveled is provided. Format your output so  
that the same labeling information is included as shown in the sample output,  
with a line of asterisks separating the cases.

Assumptions and requirements
1.      Within each data set, time intervals will be listed in chronological  
order, with the first time interval always having time 0.0 as the time of  
entry into the restricted area. All times will be given with one decimal place  
accuracy and will be in the range 0.0 to 3600.0 inclusive. For each time  
interval specified, the duration of the time interval will be positive, i.e.  
the second time specified will be greater than the first.
2.      Speeds will be in the range 0.1 to 9.9 ft/sec.
3.      Compass bearings will be given as a whole number of degrees and will be  
in the range 0 to 359 inclusive. The initial compass bearing for the first  
line of data in each data set will be 0.
4.      Within each line of data, numbers will be separated by at least one  
blank space.
5.      All numerical results will be displayed with one decimal place of  
accuracy as shown in the sample output.
6.      If the patient goes out of the restricted area, his location may include  
negative coordinates. However, you don't have to worry about the wheelchair  
crashing through the walls of the building.
