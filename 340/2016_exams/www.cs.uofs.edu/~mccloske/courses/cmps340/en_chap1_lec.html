<h2>Notes on Chapter 1 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe (5th/6th editions):
   Databases and Database Users</h2>  



<h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>

</p><p>
<b>Importance:</b> Database systems have become an essential component of
   life in modern society, in that many frequently occurring events trigger
   the accessing of at least one database:  bibliographic library searches,
   bank transactions, hotel/airline reservations, grocery store purchases,
   online (Web) purchases, etc., etc.

</p><p>
<b>Traditional vs. more recent applications of databases</b>:
</p><p>
The applications mentioned above are all "traditional" ones for which the
use of rigidly-structured textual and numeric data suffices.
Recent advances have led to the application of database technology to a
wider class of data.
Examples include <b>multimedia</b> databases
(involving pictures, video clips, and sound messages) and 
<b>geographic</b> databases (involving maps, satellite images).

</p><p>
Also, database search techniques are applied by some WWW search engines.

<h4>Definitions</h4>

The term <b>database</b> is often used, rather loosely, to refer to
just about any collection of related data.
E&amp;N say that, in addition to being a collection of related data, a
database must have the following properties:
<ul>
  <li>It represents some aspect of the real (or an imagined) world, called the
    <b>miniworld</b> or <b>universe of discourse</b>.
    Changes to the miniworld are reflected in the database.
    Imagine, for example, a UNIVERSITY miniworld concerned with
    students, courses, course sections, grades, and course prerequisites.
  </li>
  <li>It is a logically coherent collection of data, to which some meaning
    can be attached.  (Logical coherency requires, in part, that the
    database not be self-contradictory.)
  </li>
  <li>It has a purpose: there is an intended group of users and some
    preconceived applications that the users are interested in employing.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
To summarize: a database has some source (i.e., the miniworld) from which
(logically consistent) data are derived,
some degree of interaction with events in the represented miniworld
(at least insofar as the data is updated in response to changes in the
state of the miniworld),
and an audience that is interested in using it.

</p><p>
<b>An Aside: data vs. information vs. knowledge</b>:
Data is the representation of "facts" or "observations" whereas information
refers to the meaning thereof (according to some interpretation).
Knowledge, on the other hand, refers to the ability to use information
to achieve intended ends.


</p><p>
<b>Computerized vs. manual:</b>
Not surprisingly (this being a CS course), our concern will be with
computerized database systems, as opposed to manual ones, such as the
card catalog-based systems that were used in libraries in ancient times
(i.e., before the year 2000). 
(Some authors wouldn't even recognize a non-computerized collection of 
data as a database, but E&amp;N do.)

<p>
<b>Size/Complexity:</b>
Databases run the range from being small/simple (e.g., one person's
recipe database) to being huge/complex (e.g., Amazon's database that
keeps track of all its products, customers, and suppliers).

<p>
<b>Definition:</b> A <b>database management system</b> (DBMS) is a 
collection of programs enabling users to create and maintain a database.

<p>
More specifically, a DBMS is a <em>general purpose</em>
software system facilitating each of the following
(with respect to a database):
<ul>
  <li><b>definition:</b> 
      specifying data types 
      (and other constraints to which the data must conform) and
      data organization 
  </li>
  <li><b>construction:</b>
      the process of storing the data on some medium
      (e.g., magnetic disk) that is controlled by the DBMS
  </li>
  <li><b>manipulation:</b> querying, updating, report generation
  </li>
  <li><b>sharing:</b> allowing multiple users and programs to access
      the database "simultaneously"
  </li>
  <li><b>system protection:</b> preventing database from becoming corrupted
      when hardware or software failures occur
  </li>
  <li><b>security protection:</b> preventing unauthorized or malicious access
      to database.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Given all its responsibilities, it is not surprising that a typical
DBMS is a complex piece of software.
</p><p>
A database together with the DBMS software is referred to as a
<b>database system</b>.  (See Figure 1.1, page 7.)


<h3>1.2: An Example:</h3>
 UNIVERSITY database in Figure 1.2.  Notice that it is relational!

</p><p>
Among the main ideas illustrated in this example is that 
each file/relation/table has a set of named fields/attributes/columns,
each of which is specified to be of some data type.
(In addition to a data type, we might put further restrictions upon a 
field, e.g., the <b>Grade</b> field in the <b>GRADE_REPORT</b> table
must have a value from the set {'A', 'B', ..., 'F'}.)

</p><p>
The idea is that, of course, each table will be populated with data
in the form of records/tuples/rows, each of which represents some
entity (in the miniworld) or some relationship between entities.
<!-- (The previous remark alludes to the crucial idea that records,
based upon their contents, can refer to one another.)
-->

</p><p>
For example, each record in the <b>STUDENT</b> table represents a 
&mdash;surprise!&mdash; student.  Similarly for the <b>COURSE</b> and
<b>SECTION</b> tables.

</p><p>
On the other hand, each record in <b>GRADE_REPORT</b> represents a
relationship between a student and a section of a course.  And each
record in <b>PREREQUISITE</b> represents a relationship between two
courses.

</p><p>
Database <em>manipulation</em> involves <em>querying</em> and 
<em>updating</em>.
</p><p>
Examples of (informal) queries:
<ul>
  <li>Retrieve the transcript(s) of student(s) named 'Smith'.</li>
  <li>List the names of students who were enrolled in a section of 
      the 'Database' course in Spring 2006, as well as their grades
      in that course section.
  </li>
  <li>List all prerequisites of the 'Database' course.</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Examples of (informal) updates:
<ul>
  <li>Change the CLASS value of 'Smith' to sophomore (i.e., 2).</li>
  <li>Insert a record for a section of 'File Processing' for this semester.
  </li>
  <li>Remove from the prerequisites of course 'CMPS 340' the course 'CMPS 144'.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Of course, a query/update must be conveyed to the DBMS in a precise way
(via the query language of the DBMS) in order to be processed.

</p><p>
As with software in general, developing a new database (or a new application
for an existing database) proceeds in phases, including 
<b>requirements analysis</b> and various levels of <b>design</b> 
(conceptual (e.g., Entity-Relationship Modeling), logical (e.g., relational),
and physical (file structures)).


<h3>1.3: Characteristics of the Database Approach:</h3>

<b>Database approach vs. File Processing approach:</b>
Consider an organization/enterprise that is organized as a collection
of departments/offices.  Each department has certain data processing
"needs", many of which are unique to it.
In the <b>file processing approach</b>, each department would control
a collection of relevant data files and software applications to 
manipulate that data.

</p><p>
For example, a university's Registrar's Office would maintain data 
(and programs) relevant to student grades and course enrollments.
The Bursar's Office would maintain data (and programs) pertaining to
fees owed by students for tuition, room and board, etc.
(Most likely, the people in these offices would not be in direct
possession of their data and programs, but rather the university's
Information Technology Department would be responsible for providing
services such as data storage, report generation, and programming.)

</p><p>
One result of this approach is, typically,
<b>data redundancy</b>, which not only wastes storage space but also
makes it more difficult to keep changing data items consistent with one
another, as a change to one copy of a data item must be made to all of them 
(called <b>duplication-of-effort</b>).
<b>Inconsistency</b> results when one (or more) copies of a datum are
changed but not others.
(E.g., If you change your address, informing the Registrar's Office
should suffice to ensure that your grades are sent to the right place,
but does not guarantee that your next bill will be, as the copy of
your address maintained by the Bursar's Office might not have been changed.)

</p><p>
In the <b>database approach</b>, a single repository of data 
is maintained that is used by all the departments in the organization.
(Note that "single repository" is used in the logical sense.
In physical terms, the data may be <em>distributed</em> among various sites,
and possibly <em>mirrored</em>.) 

</p><p>
<b>Main Characteristics of database approach:</b>

<ol>
  <li><b>Self-Description:</b>
      A database system includes &mdash;in addition to the data stored that is
      of relevance to the organization&mdash; a complete definition/description
      of the database's structure and constraints.  This <b>meta-data</b>
      (i.e., data about data) is stored in the so-called
      <b>system catalog</b>, which contains a description of the
      structure of each file, the type and storage format of each field,
      and the various constraints on the data (i.e., conditions that the
      data must satisfy).
      </p><p>
      See Figures 1.1 and 1.3.
      </p><p>
      The system catalog is used not only by users (e.g., who need to
      know the names of tables and attributes, and sometimes data type
      information and other things), but also by the DBMS software,
      which certainly needs to "know" how the data is structured/organized
      in order to interpret it in a manner consistent with that structure.
      Recall that a DBMS is <em>general purpose</em>, as opposed to being
      a specific database application.  Hence, the structure of the data
      cannot be "hard-coded" in its programs (such as is the case in typical
      <em>file processing</em> approaches), but rather must be treated as
      a "parameter" in some sense.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Insulation between Programs and Data; Data Abstraction:</b>
      </p><p>
      <b>Program-Data Independence</b>:
      In traditional file processing, the structure of the data files
      accessed by an application is "hard-coded" in its source code.
      (E.g., Consider a file descriptor in a COBOL program: it gives a
      detailed description of the layout of the records in a file by
      describing, for each field, how many bytes it occupies.)
      </p><p>
      If, for some reason, we decide to change the structure of the
      data (e.g., by adding the first two digits to the YEAR field,
      in order to make the program Y2K compliant!),
      <b>every</b> application in which a description of that file's
      structure is hard-coded must be changed!

      </p><p>
      In contrast, DBMS access programs, in most cases, do not
      require such changes, because the structure of the data is
      described (in the system catalog) separately from the programs
      that access it and those programs consult the catalog in order
      to ascertain the structure of the data (i.e., providing a
      means by which to determine boundaries between records and
      between fields within records) so that they interpret
      that data properly.

      </p><p>
      See Figure 1.4.

      </p><p>
      In other words, the DBMS provides a conceptual or logical view
      of the data to application programs, so that the underlying
      implementation may be changed without the programs being modified.
      (This is referred to as <em>program-data independence</em>.)

      </p><p>
      Also, which access paths (e.g., indexes) exist are listed in the
      catalog, helping the DBMS to determine the most efficient way to
      search for items in response to a query.

      </p><p>    
      <em>Note:</em> In fairness to COBOL, it should be pointed out that
      it has a <tt>COPY</tt> feature that allows different application
      programs to make use of the same file descriptor stored in a "library".
      This provides some degree of program-data independence, but not
      nearly as much as a good DBMS does. <em>End of note.</em>
 
      </p><p>
      <b>Example</b> by which to illustrate this concept: Suppose that
      you are given the task of developing a program that displays 
      the contents of a particular data file.  Specifically,
      each record should be displayed as follows:
<pre> 
            Record #i:
              value of first field
              value of second field
              ...
              ...
              value of last field
</pre>
      To keep things very simple, suppose that the file in question has
      fixed-length records of 57 bytes with six fixed-length fields of
      lengths 12, 4, 17, 2, 15, and 7 bytes, respectively, all of which
      are ASCII strings. 
      Developing such a program would not be difficult.  However, the
      obvious solution would be tailored specifically for a file having
      the particular structure described here and would be of no use for
      a file with a different structure.
      </p><p>
      Now suppose that the problem is generalized to say that the program
      you are to develop must be able to display <em>any</em> file having
      fixed-length records with fixed-length fields that are ASCII strings.
      Impossible, you say?  Well, yes, unless the program has the ability
      to access a description of the file's record layout (i.e., lengths of 
      its records and the fields therein), in which case the problem is
      not hard at all.  This illustrates the power of metadata, i.e.,
      data describing other data.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Multiple Views of Data:</b>
      Different users (e.g., in different departments of an organization)
      have different "views" or perspectives on the database.  For example,
      from the point of view of a Bursar's Office employee, student data
      does not include anything about which courses were taken or which
      grades were earned.  (This is an example of a <b>subset</b> view.)
      <p>
      As another example, a Registrar's Office employee might think that
      <tt>GPA</tt> is a field of data in each student's record.
      In reality, the underlying database might calculate that value
      each time it is needed.  This is called <b>virtual</b>
      (or <b>derived</b>) data.
      <p>
      A view designed for an academic advisor might give the appearance
      that the data is structured to point out the prerequisites of each
      course.
      <p>
      (See Figure 1.5, page 14.)
      <p>
      A good DBMS has facilities for defining multiple views.
      This is not only convenient for users, but also addresses
      security issues of data access.  (E.g., The Registrar's Office
      view should not provide any means to access financial data.)
  </li>
  <p>
  <li><b>Data Sharing and Multi-user Transaction Processing:</b>
      As you learned about (or will) in the OS course, the simultaneous 
      access of computer resources by multiple users/processes is a 
      major source of complexity.
      The same is true for multi-user DBMS's.
      <p>
      Arising from this is the need for <b>concurrency control</b>,
      which is supposed to ensure that several users trying to update
      the same data do so in a "controlled" manner so that the results
      of the updates are as though they were done in some sequential
      order (rather than interleaved, which could result in data being
      incorrect).
      <p>
      This gives rise to the concept of a <b>transaction</b>, which is
      a process that makes one or more accesses to a database and which
      must have the appearance of executing in <em>isolation</em> from
      all other transactions (even ones that access the same data at
      the "same time") and of being <em>atomic</em> (in the sense that,
      if the system crashes in the middle of its execution, the database
      contents must be as though it did not execute at all).
      <p>
      Applications such as <b>airline reservation systems</b> are known
      as <b>online transaction processing</b> applications.
  </li>
</ol>

<H3>1.4: Actors on the Scene</H3>
<p>These apply to "large" databases, not "personal" databases 
that are defined, constructed, and used by a single person via,
say, Microsoft Access.
 
<p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Database Administrator</b> (DBA):
      This is the chief administrator, who oversees and manages the
      database system (including the data and software).
      Duties include authorizing users to access the database,
      coordinating/monitoring its use, acquiring hardware/software
      for upgrades, etc.
      In large organizations, the DBA might have a support staff.
  </li> 
  <li><b>Database Designers</b>:
     They are responsible for identifying the data to be stored and for
     choosing an appropriate way to organize it.  They also define
     <b>views</b> for different categories of users.  The final design
     must be able to support the requirements of all the user sub-groups.
  </li> 
  <li><b>End Users</b>:
     These are persons who access the database for <b>querying</b>,
     <b>updating</b>, and <b>report generation</b>.
     They are main reason for database's existence!
     <ul>
       <li><b>Casual end users:</b> use database occasionally, needing
           different information each time; use query language to specify
           their requests; typically middle- or high-level managers.
       </li>
       <li><b>Naive/Parametric end users</b>:
           Typically the biggest group of users; frequently query/update
           the database using standard <b>canned transactions</b>
           that have been carefully programmed and tested in advance.
           Examples:
           <ul>
             <li>bank tellers check account balances, post withdrawals/deposits
             </li>
             <li>reservation clerks for airlines, hotels, etc.,
                 check availability of seats/rooms and make reservations.
             </li>
             <li>shipping clerks (e.g., at UPS) who use buttons, bar code
                 scanners, etc., to update status of in-transit packages.
             </li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <li><b>Sophisticated end users</b>:
           engineers, scientists, business analysts who implement their
           own applications to meet their complex needs.
       </li>
       <li><b>Stand-alone users</b>: Use "personal" databases, possibly
          employing a special-purpose (e.g., financial) software package.
       </li>
     </ul>
  </li> 
  <li><b>System Analysts, Application Programmers, Software Engineers</b>:
    <ul>
      <li><b>System Analysts</b>: determine needs of end users,
        especially naive and parametric users, and develop specifications
        for canned transactions that meet these needs.
      </li> 
      <li><b>Application Programmers</b>: Implement, test, document, and
          maintain programs that satisfy the specifications mentioned above.
      </li> 
    </ul>
  </li> 
</ol>


<h3>1.5: Workers Behind the Scene</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>DBMS system designers/implementors:</b> provide the DBMS software
      that is at the foundation of all this!
  </li>
  <li><b>tool developers</b>: design and implement software tools
      facilitating database system design, performance monitoring,
      creation of graphical user interfaces, prototyping, etc.
  </li>
  <li><b>operators and maintenance personnel</b>: responsible for the
      day-to-day operation of the system.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>1.6: Capabilities/Advantages of DBMS's</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Controlling Redundancy:</b>
        Data redundancy (such as tends to
        occur in the "file processing" approach) leads to
        <b>wasted storage space</b>, <b>duplication of effort</b>
        (when multiple copies of a datum need to be updated),
        and a higher liklihood of the introduction of <b>inconsistency</b>.
        </p><p>
        On the other hand, redundancy can be used to improve performance
        of queries.  Indexes, for example, are entirely redundant, but
        help the DBMS in processing queries more quickly.
        </p><p>
        Another example of using redundancy to improve performance
        is to store an "extra" field in order to avoid the need to access
        other tables (as when doing a JOIN, for example).  See Figure 1.6
        (page 18): the <tt>StudentName</tt> and <tt>CourseNumber</tt>
        fields need not be there.
        </p><p>
        A DBMS should provide the capability to automatically enforce the
        rule that no inconsistencies are introduced when data is updated.
        (Figure 1.6 again, in which <tt>Student_name</tt> does not match
        <tt>Student_number</tt>.) 
    </li>
    </p><p>
    <li><b>Restricting Unauthorized Access:</b>
        A DBMS should provide a <b>security and authorization subsystem</b>,
        which is used for specifying restrictions on user accounts.
        Common kinds of restrictions are to allow read-only access
        (no updating), or access only to a subset of the data
        (e.g., recall the Bursar's and Registrar's office examples from above).
    </li>
    </p><p>
    <li><b>Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects:</b>
        Object-oriented database systems make it easier for complex
        runtime objects (e.g., lists, trees) to be saved in secondary storage
        so as to survive beyond program termination and to be retrievable at a
        later time.
    </li>
    </p><p>
    <li><b>Providing Storage Structures for Efficient Query Processing:</b>
        The DBMS maintains indexes (typically in the form of trees and/or
        hash tables) that are utilized to improve the execution time of
        queries and updates.  (The choice of which indexes to create and
        maintain is part of <em>physical database design and tuning</em>
        (see Chapter 16) and is the responsibility of the DBA.
        <p>
        The <b>query processing and optimization</b> module is responsible
        for choosing an efficient query execution plan for each query
        submitted to the system.  (See Chapter 15.)
    </li>
    </p><p>
    <li><b>Providing Backup and Recovery:</b>
        The subsystem having this responsibility ensures that recovery
        is possible in the case of a system crash during execution of
        one or more transactions.  
    </li>
    </p>
    <li><b>Providing Multiple User Interfaces:</b>
        For example, query languages for casual users, programming language
        interfaces for application programmers, forms and/or command codes
        for parametric users, menu-driven interfaces for stand-alone users.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li><b>Representing Complex Relationships Among Data:</b>
        A DBMS should have the capability to represent such relationships
        and to retrieve related data quickly.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li><b>Enforcing Integrity Constraints:</b>
        Most database applications are such that the semantics (i.e.,
        meaning) of the data require that it satisfy certain restrictions
        in order to make sense.  Perhaps the most fundamental constraint 
        on a data item is its data type, which specifies the universe of
        values from which its value may be drawn.  (E.g., a <tt>Grade</tt>
        field could be defined to be of type <tt>Grade_Type</tt>, which,
        say, we have defined as including precisely the values in the set
        { "A", "A-", "B+", ..., "F" }.
        </p><p>
        Another kind of constraint is <em>referential integrity</em>, which
        says that if the database includes an entity that refers to another
        one, the latter entity must exist in the database.  For example,
        if <tt>(R56547, CIL102)</tt> is a tuple in the <tt>Enrolled_In</tt>
        relation, indicating that a student with ID <tt>R56547</tt> is taking
        a course with ID <tt>CIL102</tt>, there <em>must be</em> tuples in
        the <tt>Student</tt> and <tt>Course</tt> relations, respectively,
        that describe a student and a course with those ID's.
    </li>
    </p>
    <li><b>Permitting Inferencing and Actions Via Rules:</b>
        In a <b>deductive</b> database system, one may specify
        <em>declarative</em> rules that allow the database to infer new data!
        E.g., Figure out which students are on academic probation.
        Such capabilities would take the place of application programs
        that would be used to ascertain such information otherwise.
